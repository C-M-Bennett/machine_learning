Data Mining - Perceptron:
a binary perceptron algorithm created from scratch and used to distinguish between 3 classes (data preprocessing split into pairs of data).
perceptron extended to perform multi-class classification using 1-vs-rest approach.
L2 regularisation at various coefficients used and compared.


Data Mining - Kclustering:
implemented K-means and K-medians clustering algorithms from scratch
varied K-value from 1 to 9
used B-Cubed method of computing precision, recall and F-score and plot on graphs
normalise each object to unit L2 length before clustering and compare


Applied AI - Supervised Learning:
implement and compare 3 different classification methods (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes chosen) and evaluate with usual metrics
use Pima Indians Diabetes Database
ROC curve plotted to evaluate


Applied AI - Hyperparameters:
created a neural network to solve a regression problem and test various hyperparameters in the process
test each hyperparameter separately and fix all others when testing
loss fucntion graph plotted for each change in parameter
